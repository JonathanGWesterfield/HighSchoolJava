# HighSchoolJava
The Java work I did in highschool. This includes the instructions for 
each assignment in the 'project' folder and the actual assignments in the
'Student Files' folder. I mostly use the code in this repo as a general 
reference for Java since the lessons in my high school class were so 
comprehensive. However, there is little to no comments in the files so 
it may be a little difficult to get information from it.
